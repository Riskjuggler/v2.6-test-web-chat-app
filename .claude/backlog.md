# Project Backlog - V2.6 Workflow Test

## Backlog Items from WU-002 Plan Reviews

**Date**: 2025-11-03
**Work Unit**: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

### P1 Issues

- [P1] **Scope Control**: README documentation update may belong in WU-001 or separate docs work unit rather than testing infrastructure WU
- [P1] **Testing Strategy**: Coverage validation should verify 80% thresholds don't fail with minimal sample tests - may need --passWithNoTests or lower initial threshold
- [P1] **Validation**: Coverage validation commands should check threshold percentages are actually met (grep for 80%+ in output)

### P2 Issues

- [P2] **Vision Alignment**: Consider E2E testing strategy (Cypress/Playwright) in future work unit - not blocking for unit test setup
- [P2] **Design Effectiveness**: Consider documenting testing philosophy/guidelines in future work unit for team alignment
- [P2] **Code Simplicity**: Future work units may need test utilities module - build when pattern emerges (YAGNI)
- [P2] **Tattle-Tale**: Coverage threshold verification concern raised by both Testing Strategy and Validation agents
