# Vision Alignment Output Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:50
**Recommendation**: ALIGNED

## Implementation vs Plan

Work unit planned comprehensive testing setup for frontend and backend. Implementation delivered:
- Backend: Jest + Supertest with 2 passing API tests
- Frontend: Jest + RTL with 1 passing component test (already existed)
- Coverage thresholds configured to 80% as specified
- Test scripts in package.json for both projects

## Alignment Assessment

Perfect alignment with work unit objectives. No scope creep. Infrastructure is now ready for TDD in future work units (WU-010 LLM Service, WU-020 Components).

## Value Delivered

Foundation for quality assurance established. Future work units can write tests alongside implementation. Coverage enforcement prevents regressions. Validates architecture choice (Jest ecosystem).

## Final Recommendation: ALIGNED

Implementation achieved stated objective - testing infrastructure is complete and functional.
