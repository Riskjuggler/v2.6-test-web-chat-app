# Vision Alignment Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:45
**Recommendation**: ALIGNED

## Problem Assessment
Establishes test-driven development capability before feature implementation. Solves the root need for quality assurance and regression prevention. This is foundational infrastructure, not premature optimization.

## Project Alignment
Perfectly aligned with Sprint 1 Foundation phase. Enables TDD for all future work units (LLM service, components). Industry best practice to establish testing before features.

## Architectural Fit
Jest + RTL + Supertest is standard for React/Express stack. No architectural lock-in concerns. Coverage thresholds (80%) match industry standards. Fits long-term quality vision.

## Timing
Excellent timing - right after project initialization (WU-001), before any features. Earlier is better for testing infrastructure. No upstream dependencies missing.

## Critical Concerns
- [P2] Consider adding E2E testing strategy in future (Cypress/Playwright) - not blocking for unit testing setup

## Final Recommendation: ALIGNED
Testing infrastructure is the right thing to build now - foundational for quality in all future work.
