# Testing Strategy Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:45
**Recommendation**: ADEQUATE

## Test Coverage Plan
Sample tests verify framework works (App.test.tsx, api.test.ts). Coverage reporting configured. Validation runs both test suites. Sufficient for infrastructure work unit - actual tests come in feature WUs.

## Edge Cases
[P1] Validation command should verify coverage thresholds don't fail on minimal sample tests - current 80% threshold may cause CI failures with only 2 tests. Consider --passWithNoTests or lower initial threshold.

## Assertion Quality
N/A for this work unit - infrastructure only. Sample tests will use standard assertions to verify setup (render, toBeDefined, status 200).

## Test Types
Unit tests only (appropriate for foundation). Integration tests via Supertest for API. No E2E needed yet. Covers both frontend and backend adequately.

## Final Recommendation: ADEQUATE
Testing strategy is appropriate for infrastructure setup work. Sample tests validate configuration.
