# Design Effectiveness Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:45
**Recommendation**: SOUND

## Pattern Assessment
Uses industry-standard patterns: Jest for both frontend/backend, RTL for React, Supertest for API. Separation of concerns maintained (frontend/backend test configs). Coverage reporting is standard practice.

## Tool Appropriateness
Jest: Excellent for TypeScript, well-maintained, large ecosystem. RTL: React community standard. Supertest: De facto for Express testing. All appropriate choices for stack.

## Architectural Coherence
Test infrastructure mirrors app structure (client/server separation). Configuration files in standard locations. Coverage thresholds uniform across projects. No architectural friction.

## Engineering Level
Solid professional approach. 80% coverage thresholds are realistic. Sample tests ensure configuration works. Documentation included. Appropriate for foundation phase.

## Concerns
- [P2] Consider documenting testing philosophy/guidelines in future work unit - helps team align on test quality expectations

## Final Recommendation: SOUND
Design follows best practices with no concerning deviations. Appropriate tools and patterns.
