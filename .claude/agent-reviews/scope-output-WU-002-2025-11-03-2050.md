# Scope Control Output Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:50
**Recommendation**: WITHIN_SCOPE

## Files Modified

Plan expected 8 files. Actual modifications:
1. server/src/index.ts - Export app for testing
2. server/jest.config.js - Created
3. server/src/__tests__/api.test.ts - Created
4. server/package.json - Test scripts added
5. client/package.json - Coverage config added
6. .gitignore - Already had coverage entry
7. README.md - Testing documentation added
8. client/src/setupTests.ts - Already existed from WU-001
9. client/src/App.test.tsx - Already existed from WU-001

Actual: 7 files (2 already existed from WU-001). Within expected scope.

## Scope Adherence

No feature implementation beyond testing framework. No architectural changes. Configuration-only work as planned. Excellent discipline.

## Final Recommendation: WITHIN_SCOPE

Implementation stayed within boundaries. No scope expansion detected.
