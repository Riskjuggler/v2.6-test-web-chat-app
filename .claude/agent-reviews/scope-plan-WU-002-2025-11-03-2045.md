# Scope Control Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:45
**Recommendation**: WELL_SCOPED

## Size Assessment
8 files total (3 new, 5 modified). Within acceptable range for infrastructure work. Two separate test setups (frontend/backend) but tightly scoped to configuration only.

## Boundary Clarity
Clear boundaries: Only testing framework setup, no feature implementation. Explicitly avoids actual test writing beyond samples. Frontend and backend are separate but related concerns.

## Hidden Complexity Check
Low complexity - mostly configuration files and dependency installation. Sample tests are minimal. No architectural decisions required. Standard Jest/RTL setup patterns.

## Scope Creep Risk
[P1] Work unit includes README documentation update - consider whether this belongs in WU-001 completion or separate documentation work unit. Not blocking but slight scope expansion.

## Final Recommendation: WELL_SCOPED
Appropriate size for infrastructure setup. Clear deliverables, no hidden dependencies.
