# Testing Strategy Output Review: WU-002 - Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 2025-11-03 20:50
**Recommendation**: ADEQUATE

## Test Execution

Backend: 2 tests pass (health endpoint status and content-type). Both use Supertest correctly. Tests verify framework works.

Frontend: 1 test passes (render component and find text). Uses RTL correctly. Test validates framework works.

Coverage generation works for both projects. Success.

## Coverage Reality Check

[P2] Current coverage is 100% (App.tsx) for frontend due to minimal code. Backend coverage not shown but likely low with only index.ts. 80% threshold will fail when more files added - consider starting lower (50%) and increasing gradually, or expect initial failures until sufficient code covered.

## Test Quality

Sample tests are appropriate - they validate infrastructure works, not full application behavior. Correct approach for infrastructure work unit.

## Final Recommendation: ADEQUATE

Testing infrastructure functional. Sample tests prove it works. Future work units can add real feature tests.
